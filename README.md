# Algorithms

This repository contains various algorithms in .py and .swift files.  These files were created as a method or learning CS concepts, specifially the typical algorithm questions that represent those asked during white board interviews by most tech companies as part of the software engineer interview process.

As the majority of my development background is currently in Python, I will initially be focusing on creating these code samples using Python3 and then following up with Swift.

The two main resources that I'll be using for this project are __Elements of Programming Interviews in Python__ and __Cracking The Coding Interview__.

## Elements of Programming in Python
This book begins with a summary of the nontechnical aspects of interviewing, such as strategies for a great interview, common mistakes, perspectives from the other side of the table, tips on negotiating the best offer, and a gued to the best ways to use EPI.  We also provide a summary of data structures, algorithms, and problem solving patterns.

Coding problems are presented through a series of chapters on basic and advanced data structures, searching, sorting, algorithm design principles, and concurrency.  Each chapter starts with a brief introduction, a case study, and a review of the most important library methods.  This is followed by a broad and thought-provoking set of problems.
